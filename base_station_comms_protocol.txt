MSG_HEARTBEAT=0
  Heartbeat - sent to and received from the base station
  1 associated data byte: system status
  System Status enum:
    SYS_STATE_UNINIT    // System uninitialized/state is unknown
    SYS_STATE_SETUP     // System is initializing
    SYS_STATE_STANDBY   // System is ready for flight
    SYS_STATE_ACTIVE    // System is in armed and in flight
    SYS_STATE_EMERGENCY // System is in an emergency state (i.e. aborting the mission)

MSG_STATUS=1
  Status message - sending a string to the base station to update the user and debug
  Variable length data field (length of the string) up to 128 charachters, transmitted in order

MSG_MINEFIELD=2
  Minefield info - received from the base station. Basically just telling the drone how many mines to expect
  2 data bytes:
    1) least significant byte of mine count (bits 0:7)
    2) most significant byte of mine count (bits 8:15)

MSG_MINE=3
  Mine info - received from the base station. Coordinates for a single mine, along with the location for the drone to escape to once the payload is dropped
  A sequence of mine messages fully defines the flight path of the drone
  Communicates a zero-indexed mine_id as uint16_t, and latitude and longitude values in units of deg*1.0E7 as int32_t
  18 data bytes:
    1) bits 0:7 of mine_id
    2) bits 8:15 of mine_id
    3) bits 0:7 of latitude
    4) bits 7:15 of latitude
    5) bits 16:23 of latitude
    6) bits 24:31 of latitude
    7) bits 0:7 of longitude
    8) bits 7:15 of longitude
    9) bits 16:23 of longitude
    10) bits 24:31 of longitude
    11) bits 0:7 of escape latitude
    12) bits 7:15 of escape latitude
    13) bits 16:23 of escape latitude
    14) bits 24:31 of escape latitude
    15) bits 0:7 of escape longitude
    16) bits 7:15 of escape longitude
    17) bits 16:23 of escape longitude
    18) bits 24:31 of escape longitude

MSG_TAKEOFF=4
  Signal from the base station to takeoff. Used as a trigger at the beggining of a run, or after a sandbag reload
  No associated data bytes

MSG_ABORT=5
  Signal from the base station to abort the current process and return to launch
  No associated data bytes

MSG_ACK=6
  Acknowledgement packet - Confirms to the base station that a specific message type was received
  One associated data byte:
    Type of the message that is being acknowledged
