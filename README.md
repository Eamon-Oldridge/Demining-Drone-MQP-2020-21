### Abstract
The use of PNM-1 anti-personnel landmines, along with poor documentation and scale of their deployment, has led to a humanitarian crisis. Current methods of landmine removal, including military-grade equipment, trained animals, and manual deminers, are dangerous, ineffective, and expensive. Our project will develop a cost-effective autonomous robotic solution to the world's landmine crisis by utilizing a rover and drone working in tandem. An easy-to-use application will combine these systems and make the solution accessible to non-technical users.


# Usage
All code is designed to run on a Teensy 3.5.  The Teensyduino add-on for the Arduino IDE can be installed by following the instructions here: https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html

## Note:
In order to compile, you must copy the "mavlink" folder into Arduino's libraries directory.  On Windows, this is generally "Documents\Arduino\libraries".
